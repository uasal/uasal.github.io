# Outreach and Inclusion Initiatives


Members of the lab are active in many outreach and inclusion programs, including the University of Arizona [Astronomy Camp](https://www.astronomycamp.org), the [Tucson Initiative for Minority Engagement in Science and TEchnology Program (TIMESTEP)](https://timestep.arizona.edu/) and Laser Fun Day.

# Open Projects

The UASAL team is an active contributor to projects including:

- The Physical Optics Propagation in Python library, [POPPY](https://github.com/spacetelescope/poppy). A BSD licensed open source project, POPPY provides user-friendly, high-performance set of diffraction simulation tools in both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes, broadly applicably but particularly well suited to astronomical telescopes and high-contrast imaging. 
- The Exoplanet Open-Source Imaging Mission Simulator,[EXOSIMS](https://github.com/dsavransky/EXOSIMS).
- pyKLIP, a python library for PSF subtraction for both exoplanet and disk imaging, [pyKLIP](https://bitbucket.org/pyKLIP/pyklip)
- poke, a python libary for Polarization Ray Tracing and Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition developed by UASAL supported by a NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity, [poke](https://github.com/Jashcraf/poke) (pronounced poh-keh).
- The [Space Hardware Handbook](https://uasal.github.io/spacehardwarehandbook-public/) an open space instrumentation development reference hosted on [github](https://github.com/uasal/spacehardwarehandbook-public)
