Our research interest spans from the development of new instruments and missions for space science to radiative transfer modeling of extrasolar star systems. For our previous work, see our public library from the NASA ADS: [UASAL Publications Library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/r6ora761TSasD0yJkA3y-g) and [team member]({{ '/Team' | relative_url}}) individual publications.  

A focused list of [space telescope development specific publications](spacetelpubs.md) is also available.

Contact [Ewan Douglas](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/ewan-douglas) if you are interested in joining our team or collaborating.

## Support 
Our research has been funded by a variety of sponsors including NASA and the Arizona [Technology and Research Initiative Fund](https://research.arizona.edu/trif).

To directly support our work lowering the cost of astronomy from space and developing new technologies that will help astronomers better image extrasolar planets, you can give to the [UA Foundation](https://give.uafoundation.org/science-astronomy). In the "Other" field, please type either UASAL CubeSats, UASAL Space Coronagraph Optical Bench, or Douglas Lab. For more information, see the [Steward Observatory giving page](https://www.as.arizona.edu/Giving).
