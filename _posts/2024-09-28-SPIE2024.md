This past summer team members presented research at both the Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation Conference in Yokohama and Optics+Photonics in San Diego. Continuing a blog tradition [from 2023](https://uasal.github.io/conferences/SPIE_OP_2023/). A partial summary of the conference proceedings, and arXiv links to read the preprints free of publication charges, follows: 
1. in **Van Gorkom, et al. (2024, June 27).The space coronagraph optical bench (SCoOB): 4. vacuum performance of a high contrast imaging testbed. [arXiv.2406.18885](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18885)** we discussed recent progress demonstrating <1e-8 contrast with a vector vortex coronagraph our [vacuum chamber](https://uasal.github.io/Facilities/#thermal-vacuum-testing).
1. in **Jenkins, et al. (2024, June 27).Black silicon BRDF and polarization for coronagraphic pupil masks. [arXiv.2406.19028](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19028)** we developed a rudimentary statistical model of black silicon topography and simulated incident light upon it using the finite-difference time-domain method. We hope to improve this model to explore how the metamaterial scatters light in the context of enabling the direct imaging of exo-earths with black silicon shaped pupils.  
1. in **Kang, et al. (2024, Aug 21sc).Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous wavefront sensing in space telescope applications. [arXiv.2409.10500](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10500)** we discussed recent progress on phase retrieval testbed using broadband light source with various bandpass filters.
1. in **Blomquist, et al. (2024, Aug 21sc). Alignment of three mirror anastigmat telescopes using a multilayered stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm. [arXiv.2409.04640](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04640)** this paper presents a method of early-stage alignment using a stochastic parallel-gradientdescent (SPGD) algorithm which performs random perturbations to the optics of a three mirror anastigmat telescope design.
