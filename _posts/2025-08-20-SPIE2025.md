## Stray and Scattered Light Considerations in a Non-contiguous Array of Commercial CMOS Sensors in a Space Mission

Recent advances in CMOS technology have potential to significantly increase the performance, at low-cost, of an astronomical space telescope. Arrays of sensors in space missions are typically contiguous and act as a monolithic detector. A non-contiguous array, with gaps between individual commercial CMOS detectors, offers potential cost and schedule benefits but poses a unique challenge for stray/scattered light mitigation due to complexities in the optomechanics. For example, if the array of detectors is being fed a large field of view, then each detector will have a different angle of incidence. Any individual bandpass filters need to be held perpendicular to the incoming beam so as not to create variances of central wavelength transmission from detector to detector. It naturally follows that the optical design can force filter ghosts to fall between detectors. When dealing with well-focused, high-intensity beams, first and second order stray light path analyses must be conducted to determine scattered light from glints off of individual optics/opto-mechanics or detector specific vane structures. More mechanical structures are necessary for imaging with non-contiguous arrays, all of which have potential to increase scattered light. This proceeding will document various stray light mitigation strategies for a non-contiguous array of sensors in a space telescope.


## Progress toward a demonstration of high contrast imaging at ultraviolet wavelengths

NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aims to achieve starlight suppression to the $10^{-10}$ level for the detection and spectral characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. Broadband ozone absorption features are key biosignatures that appear in the 200-400nm near-ultraviolet (UV) regime. Extending coronagraphy from visible wavelengths to the UV, however, brings with it a number of challenges, including tighter requirements on wavefront sensing and control, optical surface quality, scattered light, and polarization aberrations, among other things. We aim to partially quantify and address these challenges with a combination of modeling, high-resolution metrology to the scales required for UV coronagraphy, and—ultimately—a demonstration of UV coronagraphy on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) vacuum testbed. In these proceedings, we provide a status update on our modeling and contrast budgeting efforts, characterization efforts to understand performance limitations set by key optical components, and our plans to move toward a demonstration of UV coronagraphy.
